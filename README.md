## Now

I'm in Calgary, focusing on my own projects and playing with a hairless dog. It's marvelous. 

## About

Nerd increasingly interested in architecting inexpensive cloud solutions for everyday tasks (ie eliminate human drudgery.)  

## Work

Refusing to use anything but Typescript, currently building things with Svelte for front end and Deno for back end, keeping as much of it static/serverless as possible.

General proficiency with Photoshop/Office/Windows/AWS.
Contact me if you can help me or need my help!
